# Updates Summary - Image Generation Project

## Overview
This document summarizes all the updates made to address the issues mentioned in `context.txt`.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ‚úÖ Auto-Tagging Now Counts Total Uploaded Images
**Problem**: Auto-tagging was counting only the current upload batch, not considering previously uploaded images.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `frontend/src/components/UploadSections.jsx`
- Changed the auto-tagging logic to use the existing `uploadedFiles.length` count
- Now continues numbering from where it left off (e.g., if you have 3 images and upload 2 more, they become Image4 and Image5)

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/UploadSections.jsx`

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Custom Image Generation with Size, Background Color, and Positioning
**Problem**: Need to create images with specific sizes (like 1024x1920), custom background colors, and positioned tagged images.

**Solution**:
- Added `extract_background_color_from_prompt()` function to parse background colors from prompts
- Supports multiple formats:
  - Color names: "red background", "blue color", etc.
  - RGB values: "rgb(255, 0, 0)"
  - Hex colors: "#FF0000"
- Enhanced dimension extraction to support various formats (1024x1920, 1024 by 1920, etc.)
- Already supported positioning (center, left, right, top, bottom, background, foreground)

**Supported Colors**:
- white, black, red, green, blue, yellow, cyan, magenta, gray, orange, purple, pink, brown, lightblue, darkblue, lightgreen, darkgreen

**Example Prompts**:
- "Create 1024x1920 image with red background, @logo in center"
- "Make portrait image with blue background, @product front and @bg background"
- "1920x1080 with rgb(255, 165, 0) background, @logo top"

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/image_composer.py`

---

### 3. ‚úÖ LLM-Based Layout Correction for Promotional Requirements
**Problem**: Need LLM to understand and correct image layouts for promotional use cases.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `ollama_handler.py` to detect promotional keywords
- LLM now provides specialized layout guidance for promotional images
- Analyzes requirements like size, target audience, placement
- Suggests optimal positioning for maximum promotional impact
- Recommends background colors, text placement, and visual hierarchy

**Promotional Keywords Detected**:
- promotional, promotion, advertisement, ad, marketing, commercial, product

**Example Prompt**:
- "Create promotional image for Instagram with @product and @logo"
- The LLM will provide detailed layout recommendations following promotional design best practices

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/ollama_handler.py`

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Smart Text Handling - Only When Requested
**Problem**: Text was being added to images/GIFs even when not requested. Also needed support for multiple languages.

**Solution**:

#### Static Images (`image_composer.py`):
- Added `extract_text_from_prompt()` function
- Text is now **only added when explicitly requested**
- Detects quoted text: "Hello World", '‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á'
- Pattern matching: "text: Hello World", "add text Hello"
- Returns None if no text is requested

#### Animated GIFs (`gif_generator.py`):
- Updated `should_add_text_overlay()` to check for explicit keywords
- Added `extract_text_content_from_prompt()` for custom text
- Updated `add_text_overlay_to_frame()` to accept prompt parameter

#### Language Support:
- **English** (default)
- **Hindi** (‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä) - with Devanagari script support
- **Spanish**
- **French**
- Attempts to load appropriate fonts for each language

#### Text Customization:
- **Position**: top, center, bottom (default: bottom)
- **Color**: white text, black text, red text, blue text
- **Outline**: Automatic contrasting outline for visibility

**Example Prompts**:
- `@bg as background with text "Hello World"`
- `@product center, add text "Special Offer" in hindi`
- `@logo top with white text "Company Name"`
- `Create GIF with @img1 @img2 @img3, add text "‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á" in hindi`

**How It Works**:
- **WITHOUT "text" keywords**: No text is added ‚úÖ
- **WITH "add text", "with text", "text:", etc.**: Text is added ‚úÖ

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/image_composer.py`
- `backend/gif_generator.py`

---

### 5. ‚úÖ ZIP Functionality
**Problem**: Need ability to download generated outputs as a ZIP file when requested.

**Solution**:

#### Backend (`main.py`):
- Added new endpoint: `POST /session/{session_id}/zip/`
- Creates ZIP archive of session files
- Options:
  - `include_outputs`: Include generated images/GIFs (default: true)
  - `include_uploads`: Include uploaded source images (default: false)
- Returns downloadable ZIP file

#### Frontend (`PreviewSection.jsx`, `App.jsx`):
- Added "üì¶ Download All as ZIP" button to export options
- Automatically downloads all generated outputs in one file
- Shows helpful tooltip about ZIP functionality
- Disabled state during download

**Usage**:
1. Generate one or more images/GIFs
2. Click "üì¶ Download All as ZIP" button
3. All generated outputs are downloaded in a single ZIP file

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/main.py`
- `frontend/src/components/PreviewSection.jsx`
- `frontend/src/App.jsx`

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Test Auto-Tagging with Multiple Uploads
```
1. Upload 3 images ‚Üí Should be tagged as Image1, Image2, Image3
2. Upload 2 more images ‚Üí Should be tagged as Image4, Image5
3. Verify tag numbering continues correctly
```

### 2. Test Custom Image Generation
```
Prompts to try:
- "1024x1920 with blue background, @logo center"
- "Portrait size with red background, @product front"
- "1920x1080 with rgb(255, 165, 0) background, @logo top, @bg bottom"
```

### 3. Test Text Functionality

#### Without Text (Should NOT add text):
```
- "@bg as background, @logo center"
- "@product front and @bg behind"
```

#### With Text (Should add text):
```
- "@bg background with text 'Hello World'"
- "@product center, add text 'Special Offer'"
- "@logo with white text 'Company Name' at top"
- "Create image with @bg and @logo, text '‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á' in hindi"
```

### 4. Test Promotional Layout
```
Prompt: "Create promotional Instagram image with @product and @logo for marketing campaign"
- LLM should provide specialized promotional layout guidance
```

### 5. Test ZIP Download
```
1. Generate 2-3 images or GIFs
2. Click "üì¶ Download All as ZIP"
3. Verify ZIP contains all generated outputs
```
